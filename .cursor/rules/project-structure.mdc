# JMF Hosting Panel Project Structure

## Overview
This project is enhancing the Pterodactyl game server panel with a modern UI from @preview.html. The goal is to create a dark-themed, responsive panel with real-time monitoring and improved user experience.

## Core Architecture
- **Backend**: Laravel PHP framework with MVC architecture
- **Frontend**: Blade templates with TailwindCSS and JavaScript
- **Real-time**: WebSocket connections for live updates
- **Theme**: Dark mode with blue accents (#3182ce)

## Key Files & Directories
- [preview.html](mdc:preview.html) - Contains the development preview of the new design
- @resources/views/ - Blade templates for UI components
- @public/themes/pterodactyl/ - Theme assets (CSS, JS)
- @app/Http/Controllers/ - Backend controllers
- @routes/ - Web and API routes

## Integration Approach
1. Extract styles from @preview.html to theme CSS files
2. Implement Blade templates for each component
3. Connect to existing backend APIs
4. Add JavaScript for interactivity
